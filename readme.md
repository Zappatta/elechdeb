> elechdeb - **Elec**tron **H**ttp **Deb**bugger.
elechdeb is a HTTP debugging tool similar to fiddler, written using modern web technologies. As suggested by it's name, elechdeb is built on top of electron.js, using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
The JS framework of choice for this project is Angular 1.5, the css pre-processor of choice is less. This project is in a very early stage, with a lot of hope and good intentions for continued development.


### Supported Systems
elechdeb has been developed and tested on Windows 10, but theoretically should work on any OS supported by nodejs and electronjs. Feedback would be appreciated.


## Download

Too early to provide a downloadble installer.  


## Dev

```
$ npm install
```

### Run

```
$ npm start
```

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for macOS, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).
